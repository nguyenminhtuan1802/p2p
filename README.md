# Snow Consensus Simulator
* Simulate 200 nodes in a peer-to-peer network using localhost <br />
* Each node starts with a list of empty public transaction list and a non-empty private transaction list <br />
* Using the snow consensus algorithm, the network gradually comes to a consensus on the public transaction list <br />
* Each transaction is modelled with an ID <br />
* Run the test point: TestSnowBall in test folder <br />
